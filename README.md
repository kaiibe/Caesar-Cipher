<h1>Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption</h1>

<p>This is a Python program that allows you to encrypt or decrypt a message using the Caesar Cipher. The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique that involves shifting the letters of the alphabet by a certain number of positions.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>To run the game, you need to have Python installed on your system. Once Python is installed, you can download the code files from the repository and launch the game from your terminal or IDE by running main.py</p>

<h3>How to Play</h3>

<p>You will be prompted to choose whether you want to encrypt or decrypt a message. If you choose encode, you will encrypt a message, and if you choose decode, you will decrypt a message.
If you choose to encode a message, you will be prompted to enter the message you want to encrypt and the shift value. The shift value indicates how many positions each letter in the message will be shifted to the right. For example, if the shift value is 2, every letter in the message will be shifted two positions to the right.
If you choose to decode a message, you will be prompted to enter the message you want to decrypt and the shift value. The shift value should be the same value that was used to encrypt the original message.
Once you have entered the message and shift value, the program will output the encrypted or decrypted message.</p>

<p>If you want to play again, simply run the program again and choose whether to encode or decode a message. If you want to stop playing, you can exit the program by typing stop when prompted to encode or decode a message.
That's it! Have fun playing the Caesar Cipher game!</p>

<p>That's it! Have fun with Caesar Cipher!</p>
